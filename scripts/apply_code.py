**Philosophy:** "We cannot leak what we cannot read."

## 1. The Encryption Lifecycle

### A. Setup (Vault Creation)
1. User enters 4-digit PIN.
2. App generates random 16-byte `Salt`.
3. App derives `Key` using PBKDF2 (100k iterations).
4. App creates `Verifier` = Hash(PIN + Salt).
5. App sends `Salt` and `Verifier` to Firestore. 
6. **Session Caching:** The user's PIN is temporarily cached in the browser's `sessionStorage`. This prevents the user from having to re-enter their PIN every time they navigate between pages, while ensuring the PIN is automatically wiped by the OS the moment the browser tab is closed.

### B. Storage (Writing Data)
1. User types "I feel anxious today."
2. App checks memory for `Key`. (If missing, it attempts to derive it from the `sessionStorage` PIN, or prompts the user).
3. App generates random `IV` (Initialization Vector).
4. App encrypts text via AES-GCM -> `Ciphertext`.
5. App sends string `IV:Ciphertext` to Firestore.

### C. Retrieval (Reading Data)
1. App fetches document from Firestore.
2. App splits `IV:Ciphertext`.
3. App uses `Key` to decrypt.
4. Plain text renders in React.

## 2. Vault Control Features

### 🔒 Vault Locking (Memory Clearing)
* **Trigger:** User clicks "Lock Vault" in the sidebar or closes the tab.
* **Action:** The `EncryptionContext` sets `globalKey = null` and explicitly deletes the PIN from `sessionStorage`.
* **Result:** Even if an attacker gains physical access to the unlocked computer or browser console after the fact, they cannot decrypt data without the user re-entering the PIN.

### 🧨 Emergency Reset (Crypto-Shredding)
* **Trigger:** User forgets PIN or wants a hard reset.
* **Action:**
    1. The app deletes the `encryptionSalt` and `pinVerifier` from Firestore.
    2. **Consequence:** Without the salt, the original key can never be derived again. All existing encrypted data becomes mathematical garbage (permanently inaccessible).
    3. **Recovery:** The user must establish a new PIN and start fresh (or import a backup).

## 3. AI Privacy Boundary
When a user asks for AI Analysis:
1. Data is decrypted **in the browser**.
2. Plain text is sent to Gemini API via HTTPS.
3. Gemini processes data statelessly.
4. Response is returned.
5. **Critical:** We do NOT train models on this data.

## 4. Third-Party Data (The Service Model)
* **Context:** Users like "Lisa" store data about *other people* (Sponsees).
* **Rule:** This is a **Digital Rolodex**, not a Social Network.
* **Mechanism:** * "Sponsee" data is encrypted with **Lisa's Key**. 
    * The actual Sponsee (if they use the app) has no access to Lisa's notes about them.
    * **Zero-Knowledge applies:** If Lisa loses her PIN, the names and notes of her sponsees are lost.

* **Purpose:** Profile, Auth, & Settings.
* **Fields:**
    * `encryptionSalt` (String): Public salt needed to derive key.
    * `pinVerifier` (String): Hash(PIN + Salt) to verify PIN correctness without storing it.
    * `sobrietyDate` (Timestamp): Metrics base.
    * `role` (String): 'user' | 'admin'. Controls UI access.
    * `sponsorName` & `sponsorPhone` (String): Unencrypted. Used for SOS dialer.
    * `lastExportAt` (Timestamp): Used for the 7-day Backup Reminder.
    * `usage_limits` (Map): Timestamps (`lastWeeklyInsight`, `lastDeepDive`) to throttle AI costs.

### `journals/{{entryId}}`
* **Purpose:** Daily logs, Vitality logs, and reflections.
* **Fields:**
    * `uid` (String): Owner ID.
    * `content` (String): **ENCRYPTED BLOB** (format: `iv:ciphertext`).
    * `isEncrypted` (Boolean): Flag for legacy plain text data handling.
    * `moodScore` (Int): **UNENCRYPTED** (Allows fast dashboard stats).
    * `sentiment` (String): AI-derived sentiment (e.g. 'Positive', 'Negative').
    * `tags` (Array): **UNENCRYPTED** (e.g., `["Vitality", "Movement"]`).
    * `weather` (Map): Snapshot of environment `{{ temp, condition }}`.

### `tasks/{{taskId}}`
* **Purpose:** Gamification, Habits, and AI Action Plans.
* **Encryption:** Unencrypted to allow background stats and streak evaluations.
* **Fields:**
    * `title` (String): Task name.
    * `category` (String): 'Recovery' | 'Health' | 'Life' | 'Work'.
    * `source` (String): 'manual' | 'ai'. (AI tasks map to the Action Plan tab).
    * `priority` (String): 'High' | 'Medium' | 'Low'.
    * `status` (String): 'pending' | 'completed'.
    * `currentStreak` (Int): Consecutive completions.
